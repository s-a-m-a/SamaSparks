       At SamaSparks, we aim to provide a smooth and delightful browsing experience. As this is a hobby project and not an actual e-commerce platform, no real orders or transactions take place. However, here's how a real cancellation and return policy might look if this site were fully functional:
      </p>
      <p>
<p1> 
        Cancellation Policy
<li>Orders can be cancelled within 24 hours of placement.</li>
<li>Once the product is shipped, cancellation requests cannot be processed.</li>
<li>To cancel, simply go to the My Orders section and click on Cancel Order.</li>
</p1>
        <p1>
 Return Policy
<li>Damaged or defective</li>
<li>Significantly different from what was shown</li>
<li>Incorrectly delivered</li>
<li>Jewelry must be unused and returned in its original packaging.</li>

</p1>
</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CancellationNreturns;
